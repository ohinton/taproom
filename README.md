# Tap Room App

#### By Olivia Hinton & Meaghan Jones | Aug. 10, 2016

## Description
An Angular2 app for a bar to keep track of their kegs.

As a bartender ...

* I can fill out a form when I tap a new keg to create a display for it.
* I can see what kegs I have available. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcohol content.
* I can see a display of how many pints are left in a keg. A full keg has 124 pints in it.. I want to be able to click a button on a display of a keg whenever I sell a pint of that kind of beer and have the display of how many pints are left decrease by 1.
* I can see all the kegs that have less than 10 pints left so that I can be ready to change them.
* I can edit a keg's properties after entering them.
* I have kegs color coded to show me at a glance if they are cheap or expensive - say greater or less than $5 per pint. I also want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
